What's remarkable is that it doesn't end. The emails, the connects, the phone calls. The truth is, its never gonna "let up", or " slow down". There's just not enough time to ever take things slow. Dream your dreams. Work harder than everyone... do. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0940b046-a619-4df8-b8fd-b3bac9a2a5b1.jpg)
